#### to do's
### nicht lineare Regressionen? -> nlm
### Ã¼berprÃ¼fen nach homoskedastizitÃ¤t und Residuen sind normalverteilt und Test auf LinearitÃ¤t -> residuen Diagramm 
### multiplre Regression mit Moderator Variable (macht evtl. nicht so viel sinn)
### polynomiale Regression 
### stÃ¼ckweise linerare Regression-> wann Ã¤ndert sich die Steigung und die Entwicklung. Tritt da szufÃ¤llig mit einem Konflikt auf? 
### Bei Regressionen muss man R2 angeben: VarianzerklÃ¤rung. Mehr PRediktoren erhÃ¶hren Unterraum. Adjustierre R2 passt den Unterraum an
